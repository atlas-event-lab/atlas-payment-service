-- Phase 6: Transactional Outbox (EVT-009).
-- Payment events are written here in the SAME transaction as the payment state change;
-- the OutboxRelay scheduled publisher reads PENDING/FAILED rows and publishes them to Kafka,
-- then marks them PUBLISHED. This removes the dual-write between the database and Kafka
-- (coding-standards §Outbox & Event Publishing).
